    there is always second. so here is my guide to being a legit goal keeper </p> 
	<p>focus. I'm am naturally a very focused person so this comes naturally to me, but for some of you you may have to work on this step. 
  You must have an eye on the ball at all times even when the ball is down the other side of the feild </p> 
	<p> Backup. make sure you have a good team to back you up, if your as good as me it doen't matter but if your not? unluggy. </p>
