  <p> by Hannah McShane </p> 
  
    <p> It has taken me many weeks to be probably the best goal keeper on earth, and or though you are probably not going to be as good as me 
    there is always second. so here is my guide to being a legit goal keeper </p>

  You must have an eye on the ball at all times even when the ball is down the other side of the feild </p>
